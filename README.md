# PetMedApp
#### This is MM's PET Project, and new features will be added along the way!
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2. and it is kept up to date with the latest, that means that current version is 17.0.4.


## How to?
1.  clone the project;
2.  navigate to `package.json` and from there run `npm install` in your idee terminal or whatever terminal you are using;
3.  for a dev server run `npm start`, wait for the magic to happen and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Some of 3'rd party Libraries I used
1. [ngx-translate/core](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) - for localization. You can switch language between Romanian and English;
2. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - for smooth user Authentication;
